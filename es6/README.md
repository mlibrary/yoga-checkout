The ECMAScript 6 version of this sample uses Jasmine (with Babel and Gulp).

The tests are in `checkout.spec.js` and the stub implementation is in
`checkout.js`.

You will first need to run `npm install` to download the dependencies. Then run
`gulp` or `gulp test` to run the tests.

The package.json and gulpfile.js are borrowed from exercism.io. If you need to
set up your environment, follow their ES6 instructions:
